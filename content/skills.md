Embedded Systems & Internet of Things
```
> - There's no greater satisfaction for me than to see an embedded PCB board designed inhouse after multiple prototyping iterations.
> - The green solder mask with your custom silkscreen hides layers of efforts & hardwork gone through to get it ready.
> - The globalisation of technology & the open source adoption at the software & hardware level has truly revolutionaized the way we learn & teach electronics!
