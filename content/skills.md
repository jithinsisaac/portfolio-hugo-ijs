# Skillsets, learned & ever learning!

```
Embedded Systems & Internet of Things
```

> - There's no greater satisfaction for me than to see a final fabricated embedded PCB board designed inhouse, after multiple prototyping iterations.
> - The green solder mask with your custom silkscreen hides layers of efforts & hardwork undertaken to achieve the final result
> - The globalisation of technology & the open source adoption at the software & hardware level has truly revolutionaized the way we learn & teach electronics!
