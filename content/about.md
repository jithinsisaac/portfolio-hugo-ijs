# About the site
- I remember using wordpress, blogposts and other CMS half a decade ago, and hosting it on crappy hosting servers with buggy implementations.   
- Fast forward to 2020, the necessaity of a personal portfolio webpage inspired me to try something different. An effort of which is an attempt to design and make this portfolio & blogging page.  
- Searching around made me read about Static Web Pages and how it was taking over the domain of blogging, and basically sites with static content, by storm.  
- Consequently, I have explored & used the fabuolous [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) Static site generator and hosted it quite effortlessly on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- Hugo used Markdown as a writing language, which is better suited for info & blog sites, than HTML, which is a publishing language.
- Hugo has a certain learning curve, but when done properly, is quite satisfying.
- Big shout out to the [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) theme that i have used for this site.
