# About

```
About the site
```

- I remember using the omnipresent wordpress, blogpost and other CMS a decade ago, and hosting it on crappy hosting services with buggy implementations.
- Fast forward to 2020, the necessaity of a personal portfolio webpage inspired me to try something different. The result of which is an attempt to design and make this portfolio & blogging page.
- Searching around made me read about Static Web Pages and how it was taking over the domain of blogging, and basically sites with static content, by storm.
- Consequently, after due deligence, I have gone on to use the fabuolous [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) Static site generator(SSG) and hosted it quite effortlessly on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). (You may do it on any VPS)
- Hugo uses Markdown as a writing language, which is better suited for static information & blogging sites, than HTML, which is a publishing language.
- You may check the speed at which pages load on this website. That ones entirely coz of the SSG!
- Hugo has a certain learning curve, but when done properly, is quite satisfying.
- Big shout out to the [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) theme that i have used for this site.
