**Installation of Metabase in an AWS EC2 instance**

1. Spin up an AWS EC2 instance with the following specifications
    - Ubuntu 18.04 Server LTS OS
    - 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM (t2.medium)
    - In Security policy,
      - Open SSH Port 22 to be accessed only from your local machine/ or from anywhere.
      - Open Custom TCP Port 3000 to be accessed from any IP (0.0.0.0/0)
2. In the terminal, Update your Ubuntu repositories
```
sudo apt update
```
3. We will be installing the Metabase software by the Docker container approach. https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/operations-guide/running-metabase-on-docker.html

4. First, we need to install Docker. https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/ Run the following commands to install Docker
```
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

5. Verify that docker had installed properly.
```
sudo docker run hello-world
```
You should get the following output. If so, then docker is installed properly.

6. Run the following one-liner docker command for installating Metabase
```
sudo docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase
```
7. Start Metabase in your browser by putting in the URL as 
    - http://AWS-EC2-PublicIP:3000 if you are installing in an AWS EC2 instance
      - E.g. http://15.206.178.52:1880
    - NOTE: It takes some time for the software to run for the first time. Sometimes it can takes minutes! Please wait till you get the following landing page on your browser.
